# SmartThings-OmniPro
The included SmartApp and Device Handlers provide integration between Samsung SmartThings and HAI/Leviton OmniPro II controllers utilizing the HAILogger application as a middleman. The HAILogger connects using the HAI SDK to the controller and exposes a web service that the SmartThings hub connects to.
